# July Summary

## July 27:
Started my web3 journey! Played around with connecting to the goerli network, then setting up hardhat and writing some Solidity code.

## July 28:
Took a deep look at soubound badges https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5114. Tried to implement my own soulbound contract. Also investigated proxy contracts and upgradeability.

## July 29:
Read into integrating frontend with metamask. I'm not a fan of frontend stuff; much more of a backend type. But good to know how things operate on the client side.

## July 30:
Read / explored subgraphs. Further experimenting with next.js and vercel deployments.

## July 31:
Looked at zksync project. I want to delve deeper into blockchain applications for Rust, but that pesky borrow checker can be quite a learning curve.
