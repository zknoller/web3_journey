# August Summary

## August 01
## August 02
Took a break because I was sick. Binged evangelion rebuild movies.

## August 03
Feeling better now. Doing a lot of reading for rocketpool and eth2.0 staking. Started this journal to keep records of articles I've read and as a general text lookup resource.
Explored some gitcoin projects/bounties. For now, I want to finish reading https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd and set a preliminary goal of hosting an eth2.0 node automated.

## August 04
Completed reading all 4 sections of https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd
Traded some goerli eth for rocketpool. Getting a better understanding of metamask <> eth interactions now. At the moment, considering deploying my own solution for auto-deploying a staking node.
So far, from what I've read the merge for ETH2 reads very promising. The last time I explored the ethereum space, there was only truffle/ganache. It's crazy how many tools and platforms have grown since then.

Happy Friday!

From initial looking into staking node, I need enough Goerli ETH to try out staking first. Sadly, I don't have the twitter clout to do so right away so will be a slog.
Started looking into resources I would need to build my first pseudo dapp, a soulbound kyc registrar. Basically relying on an off-chain data provider to give a soulbound badge that would prove that a user was KYC'd. 

## August 07
Created initial code for `stamby`, project to experiment both making a proper dapp and to test the implmentation of a soulbound KYC badge. Will it actually be useful in the real world? Depends on if a soulbound badge would be enough from an operational standpoint. Then again, having some proof of a rigorous ID check (even if it is centralized) would help greatly against some spam measures (obviously high barrier to entry, although fake IDs are a thing). Either way, seems to be enough of a technical but novel challenge to try and build.
