# August Summary

## August 01
## August 02
Took a break because I was sick. Binged evangelion rebuild movies.

## August 03
Feeling better now. Doing a lot of reading for rocketpool and eth2.0 staking. Started this journal to keep records of articles I've read and as a general text lookup resource.
Explored some gitcoin projects/bounties. For now, I want to finish reading https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd and set a preliminary goal of hosting an eth2.0 node automated.

## August 04
Completed reading all 4 sections of https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-staking-protocol-part-1-8be4859e5fbd
Traded some goerli eth for rocketpool. Getting a better understanding of metamask <> eth interactions now. At the moment, considering deploying my own solution for auto-deploying a staking node.
So far, from what I've read the merge for ETH2 reads very promising. The last time I explored the ethereum space, there was only truffle/ganache. It's crazy how many tools and platforms have grown since then.
